# Data Visualization with Python

Data visualization can be defined as the use of graphical or pictorial representations to present data in a way that makes it easier to understand, analyze, and communicate. It involves the use of visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps to help users better understand and interpret complex data sets. Data visualization is an important tool for exploratory data analysis, as well as for communicating results to others. By presenting data in a visual format, data visualization can also help to reveal new connections and insights that might not be apparent from a purely numerical or textual analysis. Effective data visualization allows viewers to quickly identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, and can be used to highlight key insights or communicate complex ideas. In this project, I explained the details that need to be considered when plotting with matplotlib and plotly.
